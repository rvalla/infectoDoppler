### the documentation

**infectoDoppler** musical piece needs, in addition to a group of players, a *game* to record the samples
which make up the *population* and a *simulation model* that merges that sounds if they get infected
during an epidemic outbreak.  
The *game* is written in [p5js](https://p5js.org) and the *simulation model* in [python3](python.org).
Here I will host their documentation.  

Visit **infectoDoppler** site at [azarte.gitlab.io/infectodoppler](https://azarte.gitlab.io/infectodoppler/).
