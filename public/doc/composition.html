        <h2>epidemic model</h2>
        <p>To build a version of <span class="t_red">infecto Doppler</span> the composition software simulates an
				outbreak. Some sounds from a population get infected. The infected sounds are merged with an amplitude which
				depends on the actual percentage of population which is infected. To run the software you need python3 with
				some common libraries (numpy, pandas and scipy).</p>

        <h2>the json file</h2>
        <p>To build a version you need to instantiate <i>infectoDoppler(config.json)</i> passing the configuration
				.json file to the constructor. That file contains all the parameters you can set. The first json fields are:
				pPath (the population location), vPath (the output data, charts and audio location) and vName (the name
				for the version).</p>
      </div>
			<div class="box">
        <h2>audio control</h2>
        <p>Then you can set some audio related configurations using the following fields: sampleRate (the output files
				samplerate), channels (the number of output channels), gainControl (you can set this to linear or polynomial -
				the last one use a quadratic function), gainFactorAt0 (the change for the amplitude when 0% of the population
				is infected) and gainFactorAt1 (the change for the amplitude when 100% of the population is infected).</p>
      </div>
			<div class="box">
        <h2>the outbreak</h2>
        <p>You can set the simulation general parameters with the fields: population (if it is 0 the software loads all
				files in pPath, if it is a positive integer it loads that number of files), days (the number of days to simulate),
				daySize (the number of audio samples in a day), casesZero (number of infected files in day 1), modeContacts
				(the mode for random triangular distribution of number of contacts for an infected sound during a simulation
				day - 0 < mode < 2.mode).</p>
      </div>
			<div class="box">
        <h2>the virus</h2>
        <p>You can set virus characteristics with infectionThreshold (the probability of an infected sound infecting
				others in certain day) and immunityPeriod (the time in days during a sound can't be infected after getting
				recovered). Note that the infectionThreshold tend to be a small number because you have to consider that a
				sound is infectious during its whole duration.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="box">
        <h2>the response</h2>
        <p>You can control social response first setting the field response (true or false). When it is set true the
				software apply a restriction to sounds circulation (each sound reduce its contacts by the isolationFacto).
				You set the response configuration usinge the following fields: responseStart (the simulation day in which the
				restriction starts), actionsPeriod (the duration in days for the restriction) and isolationFactor (a float
				which determines how much the circulation is reduced - 0 <= f <= 1).</p>
			</div>
			<div class="box">
        <h2>only the outbreak</h2>
        <p>As merging the audio data is a heavy computational task you can use <i>epidemicTest(config.json)</i>
				instead. The software runs the same epidemic simulation loading the configuration from the same json files
				and export data and charts very quickly.</p>
