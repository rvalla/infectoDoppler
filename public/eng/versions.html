        <h2>free virus</h2>
        <p>The virus begins to attack the population <span class="t_blue">g4g</span> and no one offer resistance.
				The society doesn't take any contingency measures to stop it, perhaps because the virus is not fatal. 212 of the
				233 sounds get infected. The peak of the curve takes place in day 39 when 126 sounds are heard at the same time.</p>

				<p>The virus begins to attack the population <span class="t_blue">g4g</span>. This time the society restrict
				the circulation a little during 90 days. For a while the sounds believe that the outbreak is over but they
				realize that the immunity period for recovered sounds is 34 days. Nobody can stop the second wave.</p>

        <p>When the virus gets strong in the population <span class="t_blue">g4g</span> society decides to restrict

				of the curve takes place in day 78 when 74 sounds are heard at the same time.</p>

        <p>This is an open source <span class="t_blue">musical game</span>. So you can study its code
				<a href="https://gitlab.com/rodrigovalla/infectodoppler" target="_blank">here</a>. You can download the official
				populations and build your own versions. You only need python3 and some libraries. If you need help write me
