        <h2>a musical game?</h2>
        <p>During the decade of 1950 musicians as John Cage in America or Karlheinz Stockhausen in Europe introduced
				aleatory elements in their works. While I was studying this techniques I wrote <span class="t_red">the butterfly
				and its chaotic effect</span> (a game for 3 people, 1 piano and 13 ping pong balls). A musical piece which is
				built through the rules of a game and doesn't require extended musical training.</p>

				<p>I didn't know it until recently, but in 1961 Gy√∂rgy Ligeti presented a musical piece built of the noise made
				by the public following instructions from a blackboard. This work may be the more relevant background for this
				series of musical games that continue growing thanks to the public from <span class="t_blue">
        Celebration on mind</span> in Argentina.</p>
        <p>Because of the huge amount of sound objects that interact in this pieces I like to think about them as part
				of <span class="t_blue">sound-mass aesthetics</span>, another point of contact with the famous hungarian
				composer. In 2019 more than 100 people participated in the premiere of <span class="t_red">Neurobodrio</span>.</p>

        <p>Something was missing! I am Rodrigo Valla. I am the one who invites you to be part of a new game. This time
				is <span class="t_red">infectoDoppler</span>. I am going to colect sound samples to make a
        <span class="t_blue">sounds population</span> without any antibodies. The first versions of this
        <span class="t_blue">musical epidemic</span> will be presented in <span class="t_blue">Celebration of mind</span>
				event in Buenos Aires.</p>
