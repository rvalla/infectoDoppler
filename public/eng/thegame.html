        <h2>the game</h2>
        <p>When you open the game you will see a red button. You have to click on it to start the audio context
				(the browser will ask you to enable the microphone). Then you will see <span class="t_blue">stars</span>
				and <span class="t_blue">asteroids</span>. You need to choose one star and one asteroid. The star will be
				your <span class="t_blue">position</span> and the asteroid will be the <span class="t_blue">sound source</span>.
				I know, sound doesn't travel through space. Before going on, make sure to understand what the
				<span class="t_blue">Doppler effect</span> is.</p>
				<p><a href="Dopplereffect.html"><button class="big">Doppler effect?</button></a></p>

        <h2>the board</h2>
        <p>The screen is the game board. After you touches the red button the game gives you a short time to get
				ready and then <span class="t_blue">stars</span> and <span class="t_blue">asteroids</span> start moving.
				You have to pay attention to your selected star and asteroid. The recording starts and ends automaticaly.
				If you see your asteroid in the screen you have to make your sound, when it escapes from it you have to
			 	stay quiet.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="box">
        <h2>your sound</h2>
        <p>You can sing, play a musical instrument or use whatever object makes sound. You can choose between
				two types of sounds: continous (a pitch) or granular (repeated short sounds). If you decide to sing you can't
				change the vowel or syllable during a game round. May be the Doppler effect
				<a href="../p5js/infectodoppler.html">example</a> can help you to understand what to do (tap the red button).</p>
      </div>
      <div class="box">
        <h2>your interpretation</h2>
        <p>During a game round you have to modulate your sound with the animation movement. Remember, if your
				<span class="t_blue">asteroid</span> gets closer to your <span class="t_blue">star</span> you need to increase
				your sound frequency (pitch gets higher or sound repeats faster) and if it moves away you need to do the
				oposite, decrease your sound frequency (pitch gets lower or sound repeats slower). Be careful! The key is
				the speed with which your <span class="t_blue">asteroid</span> moves with respect to your <span class="t_blue">
				star</span> and not the speed of it on the screen (again, the example may help).</p>

        <h2>send your sample</h2>
        <p>The recording will stop automaticaly (it lasts between 6795 and 10976 miliseconds). Your browser will
				trigger the download of a sound file. My idea is to create a large <span class="t_blue">sounds population</span>
				so you can play again and again. There are different levels!<br>
				You can send me your files to my <a href="mailto:rodrigovalla@protonmail.ch">mailbox</a> or directly through
				<a href="https://telegram.me/rvalla" target="_blank">telegram</a>. You decide which files you send, this site
				doesn't collect any of your data. If you have problems with the game you can check the
				<a href="../doc/index.html">documentation</a> or email me.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="box">
				<h2>play now</h2>
				<p>That's all! You are ready to play. All depends on your courage. You can start with the easier levels or the
				more hard ones. You can try as many times as you want. If you read the game's url carefuly you may discover
				how to configure your own levels.</p>
