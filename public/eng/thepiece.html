        <h2>this musical game</h2>
        <p>2020 made us think a lot of stuff. I am sure that if you live in the same planet as me you heard about curves
				and how to flatten them. About virologists, epidemiologists and more. This year <span class="t_blue">
        Celebration of mind</span> event in Buenos Aires will take place in a virtual platform. So, you can play
				<span class="t_red">infectoDoppler</span> whenever you want from wherever you are.<p>
      </div>
      <div class="box">
        <h2>your mission</h2>
        <p>Your work is to be part of the construction of a <span class="t_blue">sounds population</span> that will
				suffer an <span class="t_blue">epidemic</span>. If the sounds get infected they are heard, if they don't remain
				silent. My goal is for the population to be huge so, you can record so many sound samples as you like.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="box">
        <h2>the piece</h2>
        <p>If I have a <span class="t_blue">sounds population</span> of adecuate size, a computer program will merge
				them in case they get infected. If all goes well we are going to obtain a musical representation of the curve
				about we talked a lot this year.</p>

        <h2>how can I participate?</h2>
        <p>Stochastic music is always in risk of ending in some noise without any identity. My goal with it is for
				the musical piece this game produces to be recognized with some sort of esential identity. That's the reason
				why there are rules. You have to take into account the <span class="t_blue">Doppler effect</span> while you
				are following an animation. If you know what the Doppler effect is you can jump to the rules directly.</p>
