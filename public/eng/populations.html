        <h2>the samples</h2>
        <p>After each game round you obtain an audio file and send it to me. I don't hava a way to know what device you
				have used. Perhaps you used a laptop or a cellphone. Maybe you are a very profesional player and used an expensive
				microphone. I want the relative weight of the sounds in a <span class="t_blue">population</span> to be uniform,
				so I normalize the audio signals. Sometimes I use noise reduction processes. I apply a short fade-in and
				fade-out to every file.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="box">
				<h2>the files</h2>
				The processed samples are exported in wav format with a 32 bits resolution. Limit the amplitud values between
				0 and 1 is more comfortable fot the simulation model software which runs the <span class="t_blue">epidemic</span>.
				If the samples are stereo I export each channel separately. A <span class="t_blue">sounds population</span>
				is made by a lot a this files.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="box">
        <h2>voices</h2>
        <p>Without any doubt, our voice is one of the musical instruments which we carry all time with us. The
				<span class="t_blue">sounds population</span> for <span class="t_red">infectoDoppler</span> are full of
				sounds of this class. Sometimes with continous vowels sometimes with more percussive syllables.</p>

        <h2>instruments</h2>
        <p>People who know how to play an instrument prefer to do it. Why to study so hard if when you
				have to play, it's going to stay in its case? As with voices there are continous and discrete sounds.</p>

        <h2>percussion</h2>
        <p>Those like me who have followed symphony orchestras closely know that percussion is not only about
				instruments that are hit. It is about all of those that don't fall into the other categories too. Sometimes
				the instrument is a key ring, sometimes is the kitchen faucet.</p>

        <h2>populations</h2>
        <p>By the end of October 2020 a group of players built the first <span class="t_blue">sounds population
				</span> for <span class="t_red">infectoDoppler</span>. It has a total of 233 files that add up to more than
				33 minutes of audio.</p>
