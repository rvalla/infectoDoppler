        <h2>the outbreak</h2>
        <p>An <span class="t_red">infectoDoppler</span> version consists in an epidemic outbreak simulation. A
				<span class="t_blue">virus</span> infects part of a <span class="t_blue">sounds population</span>. The
				infected sounds are heard, the lucky ones remain silent. These <span class="t_blue">infected sounds</span>
				are contagious during all their duration. When they end, the get recovered.</p>
      </div>
			<div class="box">
				<h2>the model</h2>
				<p>Each day, in the simulation, the <span class="t_blue">infected sounds</span> meet others and the model
				decides if they get infected or not. The day duration is set as a number of samples of the audio files.
				Each sound is assigned to a channel. The model simply sum the audio signals with an amplitud which depends
				on how many sounds are infected.</p>
			</div>
      <div class="box">
        <h2>the virus</h2>
        <p>The <span class="t_blue">virus</span> has two configurable features. A threshold that defines how contagious
				it is (the probability of one infecting others) and the immunity period that sounds adquire after getting
				recovered.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="box">
        <h2>social network</h2>
        <p>The <span class="t_blue">sounds populations</span> for <span class="t_red">infectoDoppler</span> are very
				uniform. The probability of one sound to meet other is equal for every sound. However, each sound object has
				its own contact factor which makes it getting in contact with more or less other sounds</p>

        <h2>social response</h2>
        <p>The <span class="t_blue">sounds populations</span> decide what to do about the outbreak. They can do nothing
				of limit sounds circulation (making them to contact less sounds and reduce new infected sounds). You can set
				both the day in which the restriction starts as its duration and its intensity.</p>
