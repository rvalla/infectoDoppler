### what is **infectoDoppler**?

**infectoDoppler** is an stochastic musical piece which is a game at the same time. A game for
players without any musical training. Is part of a series of works which started with
[The butterfly and its chaotic effect](https://vimeo.com/rodrigovalla/chaoticbutterfly) and,
until 2020, ended with [Neurobodrio](https://vimeo.com/rodrigovalla/neurobodrio).  

### sounds population
This time, due to *COVID-19* pandemic, the musical piece will be built algorithmically. It will
be inspired in the *SARS-CoV-2* outbreak.  
The *population* of sounds which suffers the virus consists in a series of sounds recorded by
players all over the world (well, most of them will be from Argentina) with their musical
representation of the *Doppler effect* induced by a visual simulation.  

### the piece
A version of the stochastic musical piece is generated by a computational model that simulates
the spread of a virus. Each *infected sound* will be listened, the lucky ones will remain
silent.
